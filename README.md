### Hi there,

My name is Chidozie Innocent Nwachuwkwu,a Data Analyst with experience in data wrangling, extraction and analyzing within the retail business space. I like to discover key trends and patterns, answer questions and communicate the insights to both technical and non-technical audience. I am adept at using  Microsoft Excel, SQL and Power BI to aid my analyses. R would soon be added to the list. I love football and video games.
